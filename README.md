# Vectorizer

Vectorizer turns any bitmap image into a vector image by breaking it up into a grid of squares (blocks), and rendering a vector element to represent the brightness of each square. Higher resolution images yield better results, but take longer to process.

Overall, Safari proved ~300% faster than Chrome. UI is still buggy in Firefox.
